A easier way to troll ban someone in Rust! Doing `/tban` announces a server message where it says that a player was banned, and `/tunban` announces that a player was unbanned all without actually banning or unbanning anyone.
A easier way to troll someone in Rust! The commands available are banning and muting, `/tmute`, `/tunmute`, `/tban`, `/tunban`, and they all annouce in the chat. Example: `/tmute Bill` - Announces `Grave muted Bill`, as I sent the command. This works with unmuting and banning/unbanning.
